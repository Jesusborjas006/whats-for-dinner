### Learning Goals:
The learning goals were to properly use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to produce a working application. 

### Wins + Challenges:
The wins that I have are that the application works the way we expected too. The challenge was trying to find a way to get the radio button that was selected to be cliked and get it's value. There was a lot to google in order to find a way to solve this issue.
